<h1>About nnBits</h1>

<p>
Hi. My name is Nick, and nnBits is my personal project, a programming playground, free from deadlines, obligations, commercial reasoning, common sense, competition and the necessity of doing everything "in a right way". I completely enjoy being a part of the big game, but nnBits is all about fun and crazy ideas. Feel free joining the project and share your works and ideas.

    Feel free e-mailing me, even if you just want to say "Hi":<br />

    A few more notes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>nnBits <strong>is not</strong> "monetizing" anything</li>
    <li>nnBits <strong>is not</strong> a portfolio</li>
    <li>nnBits <strong>is not</strong> advertising anything (I do not want to offend anybody, but advertisement makes websites really ugly</li>
    <li>nnBits <strong>is not</strong> a self-branding website</li>
    <li>nnBits is under total [benevolent] dictatorship of Nick Ivanov :)</li>
</ul>

<p> Enjoy! </p>
