<h1>Fair Credit Permissive Open Source License</h1>

<p>Permissive software licenses, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD</a>, <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>, contrary to Copyleft, allow companies and individuals to use open source code as part of proprietary software. However, most proprietary developers bury the original copyright in a very boring pile of formal notices and disclaimers, while leaving their own copyright prominent, visible and accessible. The idea of FCPOSL is to give proprietary developers all freedoms they need, but oblige them to credit the original author(s) every time and in the same manner they credit themselves. The following license is a fork of BSD 2-clause (Simplified) license with an additional requirement added.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is it possible to force proprietary software developers credit the original developers in a fair way?</h3>
<p>Yes, if we insist. A couple centuries ago nobody could even imagine that all the adult U.S. citizens would be allowed to vote regardless of race or gender. It is funny when people say something is impossible.</p>

<h3>What should I do if I think FCPOSL has flaws?</h3>
<p>I am a software developer, not lawyer. I would really appreciate if you help me improve the license.</p>
